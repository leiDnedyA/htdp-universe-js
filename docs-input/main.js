/**
 * @typedef {string} KeyEvent - String representing the key pressed.
 * @description
 * For simplicity, we represent key events with strings, but 
 * not all strings are key events. The representation of key 
 * events comes in distinct classes. First, a single-character 
 * string is used to signal that the user has hit a "regular" 
 * key, such as
 *
 * - "q" stands for the q key;
 * - "w" stands for the w key;
 * - "e" stands for the e key;
 * - "r" stands for the r key; and so on.
 *
 * Some of these strings look somewhat unusual:
 *
 * - " " stands for the space bar;
 * - "\r" stands for the return and enter key;
 * - "\t" stands for the tab key; and
 * - "\b" stands for the backspace key.
 *
 * On rare occasions your programs may also encounter "\u007F",
 * which is the string representing the delete key (aka rubout).
 *
 * Second, some keys have multiple-character string representations. 
 * Strings with more than one character denote arrow keys or other
 * special events, starting with the four most important ones:
 *
 * - "left" is the left arrow;
 * - "right" is the right arrow;
 * - "up" is the up arrow;
 * - "down" is the down arrow;
 *
 * Here are some others that you may encounter:
 * - "start"
 * - "cancel"
 * - "clear"
 * - "shift"
 * - "rshift"
 * - "control"
 * - "rcontrol"
 * - "menu"
 * - "pause"
 * - "capital"
 * - "prior"
 * - "next"
 * - "end"
 * - "home"
 * - "escape"
 * - "select"
 * - "print"
 * - "execute"
 * - "snapshot"
 * - "insert"
 * - "help"
